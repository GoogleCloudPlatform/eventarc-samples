In this sample, you'll see how to publish events to a channel-connection as a
third-party provider using client libraries. The samples assume that you
registered as an event provider following the process outlined in [Offer an
Eventarc
source](https://cloud.google.com/eventarc/docs/third-parties/offer-source) and
created a channel-connection to publish events to.

## Before you begin

Make sure your project id is set in `gcloud`:

```sh
gcloud config set project PROJECT_ID
```

## Create a channel, a service, and a trigger
